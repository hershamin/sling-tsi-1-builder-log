We finished inventory for the Empennage kit, found almost all the items in it, except for one (_Composite Rudder Tip_), which has been reported to the airplane factory via _Slingshot_. Few parts are fairly scratched up (see section below), waiting on an answer to see if I need to order a replacement or not.

## Organizing parts
Different category of parts has been organized in our 2 car garage into few main sections:
* **Spars:** For the spanwise parts of the stabilizers and the control surfaces.
* **Ribs:** For the chordwise parts of the stabilizers and the control surfaces.
* **Skins:** For the skin themselves, and also the counter weights.
* **Small Parts:** For small parts such as angle brackets.
* **Hardware:** For tools and parts to join together such as rivets, rivnuts, etc.

### Disclaimer
The parts for the time being are laid out on the floor of the garage, since I did not have enough time to build the tables, but since the kit is already here, might as well start on it. Also, on a sidenote, airplane parts on an ocean themed epoxy floor looks great!
